                    MHacks is a 36-hour hackathon run by University of Michigan students. At MHacks, we want to help you
                    to turn your ideas into reality. You're welcome to come with or without a team. We'll provide you
                    with all the resources and mentors you need to help you work on something cool or learn new skills.
                    You'll have the freedom to create a product, learn new techniques for your future work, or just have
                    fun working on a project with friends. Moreover, we will offer you a chance to network with other
                    creators and professionals. For newcomers and veterans alike, MHacks is a weekend experience you
                    won’t want to miss.

                <p class="big-text">
                    MHacks has always been about the freedom to create what your heart desires. At MHacks 9, we’d love
                    to help you turn your dreams into something better than what you imagined. MHacks hackers are
                    well-known for creating technically unique and complex hacks, but this year MHacks 9 will promote an
                    Empathy-Driven Design process. We will guide you through using empathetic drivers to create
                    solutions that are not only functional, but also user-friendly.
                </p>
                <p class="big-text">
                    You can expect an even more collaborative, instructional, and inclusive environment than ever
                    before. We’ll be inviting speakers and mentors from a variety of disciplines to help hackers plan
                    and design hacks that users will provide users with enjoyable and meaningful interactions. Workshops
                    and resources will guide hackers throughout the event from ideation to launch. We’ll also have tools
                    and activities for hackers to form teams and leverage their individual expertise to create an even
                    more exemplary product together.
                </p>
                <p class="big-text">
                    As always, we’ll continue to focus on providing a healthy and fun atmosphere for hackers to work.
                    Nutritious food options, showers, and wellness-focused activities will be some of our top
                    priorities. Hackers can take a break from the hustle and bustle of hacking with snacks and games
                    throughout the event. Hopefully, you’ll finish MHacks feeling more refreshed than you were before!
